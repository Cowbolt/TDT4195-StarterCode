3a:

1. Take the fourier transform of an image
2. Perform convolution on the fourier transformed image with some filter (in accordance with the convolution theorem).
3. Retrieve the inverse transform of the result.


3b:
High-pass filters take on values which are at least some distance away from the center (zero-frequency component).
High-pass filters take on values which are at least some distance close to the center.


3c:

The values of a and b are some minimum distance from the center, so they are high-pass filters.
c has values which are at most some distance away from the cetner, so it's a low pass filter.
